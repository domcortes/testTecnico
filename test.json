There are currently 7 numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Regions 13889 (~S09W108) and 13897 (S10W84) produced several M-class flares during the reporting period and may be the source of far-sided activity during the outlook period. Additionally,  Active Regions 13893 (S19W26) and 13901 (S08E42) produced two M-class flares and seven M-class flares, during the reporting period, respectively. These two regions are likely to exhibit more flaring activity throughout the outlook period as they continue to traverse the Earth-facing disk. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. A small coronal hole currently centered around S08W33 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) may become geoeffective on or around 2024-11-21. Additionally, coronal hole structures centered around S15W05 and N15W10 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO/AIA) are currently crossing the central meridian of the Earth-facing disk and may become geoeffective on or around 2024-11-23.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"

This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at moderate levels during this reporting period with 1 X-class flare, 29 M-class flares, and 8 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the flank of the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-11-11T01:23Z would reach NASA missions near Earth at about 2024-11-14T00:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) with a possible Kp index of 3-4 (below minor) (see notification 20241111-AL-001).\n\nIt was also estimated that the following CME is predicted to impact the listed locations:\n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2024-11-11T01:23Z   Solar Orbiter at 2024-11-13T02:00Z (glancing blow) and Lucy at 2024-11-13T08:00Z (glancing blow) (see notification 20241111-AL-001)\n\nGeomagnetic activity reached minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <= 5.33 during the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 5.33 occurred during the synoptic period 2024-11-10T18:00Z-21:00Z. The minor enhancements of geomagnetic activity observed during the reporting period were associated with a long duration arrival signature for which an interplanetary shock was identified at L1 by ACE and DSCOVR as early as 2024-11-07T14:29Z. This arrival signature exhibits flux rope signatures which likely correspond to the arrival of the S-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-11-04T17:24Z and the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-11-05T00:09Z (see notification 20241108-AL-001).\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt briefly crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu at 2024-11-07T15:35Z (see notifications 20241107-AL-001 and 20241107-AL-002) but subsided to background levels later on 2024-11-07. This elevation of energetic electron flux levels was likely associated with the arrival of the S-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2024-10-31T13:48Z detected at L1 by ACE and DSCOVR at 2024-11-03T16:47Z. The energetic electron flux levels subsided towards background levels later on 2024-11-07 and remained at or slightly above background levels during the remainder of the reporting period.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this reporting period due to the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2024-11-06  02:28:00  02:46:00  02:38:00   M1.1   S06E15 ( 13883 ) \n2024-11-06  03:02:00  03:14:00  03:09:00   M1.2   S06E15 ( 13883 ) \n2024-11-06  07:36:00  08:23:00  08:04:00   M2.9   S06E15 ( 13883 ) \n2024-11-06  08:48:00  08:54:00  08:50:00   M5.8   N16W60 ( 13887 ) \n2024-11-06  11:56:00  12:10:00  12:04:00   M1.5   S06E15 ( 13883 ) \n2024-11-06  12:56:00  13:11:00  13:02:00   M1.2   S10E90 ( 13889 ) \n2024-11-06  13:36:00  13:46:00  13:40:00   X2.3   S06E13 ( 13883 ) \n2024-11-06  14:27:00  14:45:00  14:38:00   M5.3   S10E90 ( 13889 ) \n2024-11-06  15:50:00  16:03:00  15:57:00   M1.6   S10E90 ( 13889 ) \n2024-11-06  17:10:00  17:23:00  17:18:00   M1.2   S10E90 ( 13889 ) \n2024-11-06  18:53:00  19:13:00  18:59:00   M1.1   S10E90 ( 13889 ) \n2024-11-06  20:35:00  20:52:00  20:42:00   M1.3   S10E90 ( 13889 ) \n2024-11-06  22:43:00  23:10:00  23:05:00   M1.1   S10E90 ( 13889 ) \n2024-11-06  23:10:00  23:21:00  23:16:00   M1.1   S10E90 ( 13889 ) \n2024-11-06  23:24:00  23:31:00  23:28:00   M1.2   S10E90 ( 13889 ) \n2024-11-06  23:42:00  00:16:00  00:04:00   M1.6   S06E08 ( 13883 ) \n2024-11-07  01:15:00  01:39:00  01:27:00   M2.5   S10E90 ( 13889 ) \n2024-11-07  03:52:00  04:32:00  04:20:00   M2.5   S07E04 ( 13883 ) \n2024-11-07  07:20:00  07:36:00  07:26:00   M1.3   S09E05 ( 13883 ) \n2024-11-07  07:36:00  07:46:00  07:43:00   M1.6   S11E85 ( 13889 ) \n2024-11-07  07:46:00  08:01:00  07:54:00   M2.7   S11E85 ( 13889 ) \n2024-11-07  11:53:00  12:11:00  12:02:00   M1.4   S08E78 ( 13889 ) \n2024-11-07  14:49:00  15:20:00  15:06:00   M2.3   S08W03 ( 13883 ) \n2024-11-08  02:53:00  03:12:00  03:01:00   M1.5   S06W07 ( 13883 ) \n2024-11-09  20:44:00  20:54:00  20:50:00   M1.2   S10E37 ( 13889 ) \n2024-11-10  00:04:00  00:23:00  00:15:00   M4.2   S07E34 ( 13889 ) \n2024-11-10  11:51:00  12:14:00  12:06:00   M9.4   S10E27 ( 13889 ) \n2024-11-10  20:09:00  20:34:00  20:21:00   M4.9   S12E35 ( 13889 ) \n2024-11-11  05:07:00  05:36:00  05:26:00   M1.1   S08E19 ( 13889 ) \n2024-11-11  05:36:00  05:52:00  05:43:00   M1.4   S08E17 ( 13889 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2024-11-11T01:23Z     ~984            C               -25/19                15                          SOHO                              \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2024-11-07T06:09Z     ~926            C                73/-40               40                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2024-11-07T10:24Z     ~704            C                83/-46               15                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-11-10T23:09Z     ~921            C                86/-10               24                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2024-11-11T16:48Z     ~515            C               -26/-58               30                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-11-12T11:00Z     ~565            C                -2/-49               13                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-11-12T13:36Z     ~846            C                90/34                37                          SOHO                              \n2024-11-12T19:00Z     ~669            C                85/34                34                          SOHO, STEREO A   \n\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2024-11-13T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2024-11-19T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between moderate and high levels throughout the outlook period. There are currently seven numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13889 (S09W14) was the source of numerous M-class flares observed during the reporting period and may continue to exhibit notable flaring activity throughout the outlook period. Additionally, Active Region 13883 (S06W86), which produced several M-class flares and an X2.3 flare during the reporting period, is expected to rotate off the Earth-facing disk on or around 2024-11-14 and may be the source of far-sided activity.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. Coronal hole structures currently centered around N22W30 and N08E05 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) may become geoeffective on or around 2024-11-14 and 2024-11-17, respectively. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"

The leading edge or flank of the CME will reach Lucy at 2024-11-13T08:00Z and Solar Orbiter at 2024-11-13T02:00Z (plus minus 7 hours). \n\nThe simulation also indicates that the CME may have a cursory glancing blow at NASA missions near Earth. Simulations indicate that the flank of the CME may reach NASA missions near Earth at about 2024-11-14T00:00Z (plus minus 7 hours). The roughly estimated expected range of the maximum Kp index is 3-4 (below minor).\n   \n  \nLinks to the movies of the modeled event (includes CME: 2024-11-11T01:23:00-CME-001):\n\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20241111_042400_2.0_anim.tim-den.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20241111_042400_2.0_anim.tim-vel.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20241111_042400_2.0_ENLIL_CONE_timeline.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20241111_042400_2.0_ENLIL_CONE_SolO_timeline.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20241111_042400_2.0_ENLIL_CONE_Lucy_timeline.gif\n\n\n## Notes: \n\n\nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"

The highest value of Kp = 4.33 occurred during the synoptic period of 2024-11-04T03:00-06:00Z. This slight enhancement in geomagnetic activity was associated with the interplanetary shock detected at L1 by ACE and DSCOVR at 2024-11-03T16:47Z, which was associated with the arrival of the S-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-10-31T13:48Z.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES, both >15.8-39.8 MeV and >28.2-50.1 MeV channels at SOHO, and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were elevated above their respective thresholds at the start of the reporting period due to a prior solar energetic particle event first detected in the previous reporting period at GOES around 2024-10-26T18:05Z (see notifications 20241026-AL-008, 20241026-AL-009), at SOHO around 2024-10-26T18:57Z (see notification 20241026-AL-010), and at STEREO A around 2024-10-28T08:57Z (see notifications 20241028-AL-001, 20241028-AL-002). The >10 MeV integral proton flux at GOES decreased below its threshold of 10 pfu on 2024-11-01, gradually returning to background levels a few days later on 2024-11-04. The >15.8-39.8 MeV and >28.2-50.1 MeV channels at SOHO decreased below the threshold of 10^(-1) pfu/MeV on 2024-11-01, gradually retruning to background levels several days later on 2024-11-05. The 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A decreased below the threshold of 10^(-1) pfu/MeV on 2024-10-31, later subsiding to near-background levels on 2024-11-05. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this reporting period due to the waning solar energetic particle event at GOES, SOHO, and STEREO A initially observed during the previous reporting period as described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2024-10-30  20:29:00  21:14:00  20:53:00   M7.2

Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2024-11-06T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2024-11-12T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between moderate and high levels during the outlook period. There are currently 8 numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13872 produced an M4.1 flare with a wide CME (S15W88) as it rotated off the west limb on 2024-11-05, and may be the source of far-sided eruptive activity beyond the limb. Active Region 13883 (S06E09) produced many of the flares observed during the reporting period and recently produced an X2.3 flare during the outlook period on 2024-11-06. This active region will likely exhibit more flaring activity throughout the outlook period as it rotates across the Earth-facing disk. A new, presently unnumbered, active region rotating onto the southeast limb (around S10E90) has produced an M5.3 flare along with several lower M-class flares. This region may continue to exhibit notable flaring activity as it rotates onto the Earth-facing disk.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between below minor and moderate levels during the outlook period. The O-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-11-04T01:36Z is anticipated to impact missions near Earth on or around 2024-11-06 and could result in an increase in geomagnetic activity. A small coronal hole currently centered around N03W24 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO/AIA) may become geoeffective on or around 2024-11-07. A more significant coronal hole centered at S33W02 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO/AIA) is currently crossing the central meridian of the Earth-facing disk and may become geoeffective on or around 2024-11-09. Lastly, a coronal hole structure centered near N15E45 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO/AIA) has the potential to become geoeffective towards the end of the outlook period on or around 2024-11-12. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"

ENSEMBLE PRODUCT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT MODE. PLEASE LET US KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR MODIFICATIONS.  \n\nEnsemble modeling update on CME with ID 2024-11-04T01:36:00-CME-001 (see previous notification 20241104-AL-001). Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact NASA missions near Earth. Out of 32 ensemble members (see notes section), 19 (59%) indicate impact at NASA missions near Earth. Ensemble simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2024-11-06T07:28Z and 2024-11-06T16:17Z (average arrival 2024-11-06T11:32Z). The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 89% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 4-6 range (below minor to moderate).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-11-04_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA075/20241104_013600_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA075_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-11-04_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA075/20241104_013600_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA075_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-11-04_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA075/20241104_013600_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA075_Earth_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-11-04_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA075/Detailed_results_20241104_013600_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA075.txt\n\n###\nThis CME event (2024-11-04T01:36:00-CME-001) is also predicted to have an impact at Lucy at 2024-11-05T18:12Z, Parker Solar Probe at 2024-11-05T17:36Z, Solar Orbiter at 2024-11-05T10:49Z, and STEREO A (glancing blow) at 2024-11-07T02:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) based on previous heliospheric modeling (see notification 20241104-AL-001).\n\n"

The highest value of Kp = 4.67 occurred during the synoptic period of 2024-10-28T03:00Z-06:00Z. This enhancement in geomagnetic activity was associated with the interplanetary shock detected at L1 by ACE and DSCOVR at 2024-10-28T04:13Z (see notification 20241028-AL-003) which was likely associated with the arrival of the O-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-10-26T06:48Z (see notifications 20241026-AL-007, 20241027-AL-001). The arrival of this CME was also detected by STEREO A at 2024-10-28T16:58Z.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nA solar energetic particle event was detected by SOHO and GOES during the reporting period. Beginning on 2024-10-24, the particle environment at SOHO and GOES became elevated above background levels but below their respective thresholds due to the X3.3 class flare from Active Region 13869 peaking at 2024-10-24T03:57Z (see notifications 20241024-AL-001, 20241024-AL-002) and associated O-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-10-24T03:48Z (see notifications 20241024-AL-003, 20241024-AL-004). At SOHO, the flux of one or more of the >15.8 MeV protons channels exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2024-10-26T18:57Z (see notification 20241026-AL-010). At GOES, the integral flux of the >10 MeV protons exceeded 10 pfu starting at 2024-10-26T18:05Z (see notifications 20241026-AL-008, 20241026-AL-009). This solar energetic particle event was associated with several events observed on 2024-10-26 which include back-to-back M9.5 and X1.8 class flares from Active Region 13873 peaking at 2024-10-26T06:23Z and 2024-10-26T07:19Z, respectively (see notifications 20241026-AL-002, 20241026-AL-003, and 20241026-AL-004), an O-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-10-26T06:48Z associated with these M9.5 and X1.8 flares (see notifications 20241026-AL-007 and 20241027-AL-001), and the arrival of the previously mentioned O-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-10-24T03:48Z detected as an interplanetary shock at L1 by ACE and DSCOVR at 2024-10-26T15:34Z.\n\nThe solar energetic particle environment was enhanced once again during the arrival of the O-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-10-26T06:48Z detected as an interplanetary shock at L1 by ACE and DSCOVR at 2024-10-28T04:13Z (see notification 20241028-AL-003). For the remainder of the reporting period, the particle environment at SOHO and GOES remained elevated above their respective thresholds.\n\nA solar energetic particle event was detected by STEREO A. Beginning on 2024-10-25, the particle environment at STEREO A became elevated above background levels. This elevation is associated with the X3.3 class flare from Active Region 13869 and associated O-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-10-24T03:48Z which had a detected arrival at STEREO A at 2024-10-27T10:24Z. At STEREO A, the flux of the 13-100 MeV protons exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2024-10-28T08:57Z (see notifications 20241028-AL-001, 20241028-AL-002). This solar energetic particle event is likely associated with the previously described back-to-back M9.5 and X1.3 class flares from Active Region 13873 and associated O-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-10-26T06:48Z. Subsequent enhancements in the particle environment at STEREO A may be associated with the arrival of this O-type CME as detected by STEREO A at 2024-10-28T16:58Z. The flux of the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A began to slightly subside on 2024-10-29 but still remained above the threshold of 10^(-1) pfu/MeV through the end of the reporting period. \n\nSpace

ENSEMBLE PRODUCT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT MODE. PLEASE LET US KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR MODIFICATIONS.  \n\nEnsemble modeling update on CME with ID 2024-10-26T06:48:00-CME-001 (see previous notification 20241026-AL-007). Based on heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact NASA missions near Earth. Out of 40 ensemble members (see notes section), 10 (25%) indicate impact at NASA missions near Earth. Ensemble simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2024-10-27T20:54Z and 2024-10-28T04:22Z (average arrival 2024-10-28T00:46Z). The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 67% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 5-7 range (minor to strong).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-10-26_ncmes1_sims40_LAHAINA074/20241026_064800_ncmes1_sims40_LAHAINA074_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-10-26_ncmes1_sims40_LAHAINA074/20241026_064800_ncmes1_sims40_LAHAINA074_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-10-26_ncmes1_sims40_LAHAINA074/20241026_064800_ncmes1_sims40_LAHAINA074_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-10-\n\n## Notes:\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-10-26_ncmes1_sims40_LAHAINA074/Detailed_results_20241026_064800_ncmes1_sims40_LAHAINA074.txt\n\n\n"

ENSEMBLE PRODUCT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT MODE. PLEASE LET US KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR MODIFICATIONS.  \n\nEnsemble modeling update on CME with ID 2024-10-24T03:48:00-CME-001 (see previous notification 20241024-AL-003). Based on heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact NASA missions near Earth. Out of 32 ensemble members (see notes section),  3 (9%) indicate impact at NASA missions near Earth. Ensemble simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2024-10-25T21:17Z and 2024-10-26T00:49Z (average arrival 2024-10-25T23:28Z). The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 100% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 5-7 range (minor to strong).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-10-24_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA073/20241024_034800_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA073_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-10-24_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA073/20241024_034800_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA073_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-10-24_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA073/20241024_034800_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA073_Earth_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nThis CME event (2024-10-24T03:48:00-CME-001) is also predicted to have an impact at Lucy at 2024-10-25T11:26Z, Parker Solar Probe at 2024-10-25T02:47Z, Solar Orbiter at 2024-10-24T23:53Z, OSIRIS-APEX (glancing blow) at 2024-10-26T00:00Z and STEREO A (glancing blow) at 2024-10-26T20:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) based on previous heliospheric modeling (see notification 20241024-AL-003).\n\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-10-24_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA073/Detailed_results_20241024_034800_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA073.txt\n\n\n\n"

The highest value of Kp = 4.67 occurred during the synoptic period 2024-10-19T00:00Z-03:00Z.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt briefly crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu at 2024-10-18T15:55Z (see notifications 20241018-AL-001 and 20241018-AL-002). This elevation of energetic electron flux levels was associated with a coronal hole high speed stream arrival detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2024-10-16, which reached a maximum sustained speed of approximately 500 km/s. The energetic electron flux levels subsided towards background levels later on 2024-10-18 and remained at or slightly above background levels during the remainder of the reporting period.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this reporting period due to the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2024-10-16  03:12:00  03:21:00  03:19:00   M3.0   S05W38 ( 13854 ) \n2024-10-16  03:21:00  03:26:00  03:23:00   M3.7   S08W38 ( 13852 ) \n2024-10-16  03:28:00  03:35:00  03:31:00   M2.2   S10W40 ( 13852 ) \n2024-10-16  03:38:00  03:59:00  03:46:00   M3.7   S06W37 ( 13854 ) \n2024-10-16  04:57:00  05:29:00  05:15:00   M2.8   S08W37 ( 13852 ) \n2024-10-16  13:12:00  13:38:00  13:27:00   M1.5   S10W45 ( 13852 ) \n2024-10-16  14:29:00  14:51:00  14:42:00   M1.3   S09W44 ( 13852 ) \n2024-10-16  14:51:00  15:04:00  15:00:00   M1.3   S07W43 ( 13852 ) \n2024-10-17  02:12:00  02:38:00  02:22:00   M1.0   N10W09 ( 13856 ) \n2024-10-17  04:53:00  05:13:00  05:05:00   M2.4   S04W55 ( 13854 ) \n2024-10-18  17:28:00  17:41:00  17:36:00   M1.1   S03W76 ( 13854 ) \n2024-10-18  19:27:00  19:43:00  19:38:00   M4.8   S04W80 ( 13854 ) \n2024-10-18  23:13:00  23:38:00  23:28:00   M4.7   S04W80 ( 13854 ) \n2024-10-19  06:48:00  07:03:00  06:56:00   M6.5   S03W82 ( 13854 ) \n2024-10-19  14:27:00  14:40:00  14:34:00   M1.7   S04W85 ( 13854 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nNONE\n\nNon-Earth directed (POS = Plane Of Sky):\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2024-10-16T23:12Z     ~980            C              -166/6                 40                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-10-19T09:24Z     ~1015           O               -73/19                34                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-10-19T09:48Z     ~708            C              -148/-64               14                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-10-21T05:24Z     ~703            C              -117/12                10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-10-21T11:24Z     ~702            C              -100/20                10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-10-21T15:24Z     ~565            C              -119/-23               42                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-10-22T10:00Z     ~888            C               -95/11                13                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-10-22T17:24Z     ~656            C               -95/-46               24                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2024-10-23T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2024-10-29T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels during the outlook period. There are currently seven numbered active regions on the Earth-facing disk. During the beginning of the outlook period, Active Region 13863 (S09E07) may become a source for flaring near the center of the Earth-facing disk, as it recently produced a C5.1 flare. Newly numbered Active Region 13869 (observed towards the SE limb of the Earth-facing disk) may be the formerly numbered Active Region 13842 which was responsible for four X-class flares in a previous reporting period (including an X7.1 and X9.0 flare). This newly numbered Active Region may exhibit flaring activity as it traverses the Earth-facing disk during the outlook period. Active Regions 13852 and 13854 were responsible for the majority of flaring within the reporting period but rotated off the Earth-facing disk after 2024-10-20 and may now be the source of far-sided activity during the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. An equatorial coronal hole currently centered around S04W20 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) and may become geoeffective on or around 2024-10-24. Another coronal hole structure currently centered around S18E17 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) may become geoeffective on or around 2024-10-28.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"
